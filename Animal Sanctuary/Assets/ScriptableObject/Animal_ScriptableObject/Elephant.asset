  animalFactArray:
  - Elephant tusks are actually enlarged incisor teeth which first appear when elephants
    are around 2 years old. Tusks continue growing throughout their lives.
  - Elephants communicate in a variety of ways - including sounds like trumpet calls
    (some sounds are too low for people to hear), body language, touch and scent.
  - The elephant's temporal lobe (the area of the brain associated with memory) is
    larger and denser than that of people - hence the saying 'elephants never forget'.
