  animalFactArray:
  - Compared to other big cat species, lions are the most sociable. They live in
    groups called prides.
  - Within their pride, female lions act as the primary hunters and work in teams
    to prey on zebras, wildebeests, antelope, and other large herbivores.
  - Lions sleep up to 20 hours a day, so most of their hunting is done at night or
    early in the morning.
